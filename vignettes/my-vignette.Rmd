1. Introduction
---------------------
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Though a small chemical change in the genome, DNA methylation has significant
impact in several diseases, developmental processes and other biological 
changes. Hence methylation data should be analyzed carefully to gain 
biological insights. **scmeth** package offers a few functions to asseess
the quality of the methylation data. 
</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">
This bioconductor package contains functions to perform quality control and 
preprocessing analysis for single-cell methylation data. *scmeth* is 
especially customized to use the output from the fireCloud implementation of 
methylation pipeline. For now only human and mouse genomes are supported in 
this package but in the future we will expand to other organisms. In addition 
to individual functions, **report** function in the package provides all 
inclusive report using most of the functions. If users prefer
they can just use the **report** function to gain summary of their data.
</p>

2. Installation
---------------------
**scmeth** is available in bioconductor and can be downloaded using the 
following commands
```{r, eval=FALSE}
source("http://bioconductor.org/biocLite.R")
biocLite("scmeth")
```

3. Input files
---------------------
<p style="text-align: justify;">


Main input for most of the function is a *bsseq* object. In the fireCloud 
implementation it is stored as hdf5 file which can be read via 
*loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment* function in *SummarizedExperiment* package.
Code chunk below shows how it can be loaded.
</p>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# Works in devtools::check but not in bioconductor
directory<-system.file("extdata","bismark_data",package='scmeth')
bsObject<-SummarizedExperiment::loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment(directory)
```



4. Usage
---------------------

4.1 Report
--------------

<p style="text-align: justify;">
A comprehensive quality control report can be generated in the package via 
**report** function. report function takes the bs object, 
the directory where the report should be saved, organism that this data is 
obtained from and the genomic build. Following is an example usage of the 
**report** function.

**report** function also takes two optional arguments: *subSample* and 
*offset*. With subsample parameter users can choose how many CpGs to consider
in the analysis out of all the CpG information available. Our analysis 
have shown that conducting analysis with one million CpGs is suffice to capture
the quality of the samples. However when more CpGs are added they reflect
the full data precisely. Offset parameter is to avoid any telomere region
when subsetting from the beginning of the data. 


</p>

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(scmeth)
scmeth::report(bsObject, '~/Documents',Hsapiens,"hg38")
```


<p style="text-align: justify;">
Command above generayed an html report named *qcReport.html*. It will be stored
in the indicated directory. 
</p>

4.2 Functions
-----------------
<p style="text-align: justify;">
This section will elaborate on some of the main functions and show the usage 
of these functions based on a sample data set that comes along with the 
package. 

**scmeth** package contains several functions to assess different metrics and 
success of the sequencing process. 

### coverage
One main metric is the CpG coverage. Coverage of the CpG can be assessed in 
different ways. Very basic one is to check how many CpG were observed in each 
sample. **coverage** function can be used to get this information. 

</p>
Loading the data
```{r,  warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,comment=FALSE,}
library(scmeth)
directory<-system.file("extdata/bismark_data",package='scmeth')
bsObject<-SummarizedExperiment::loadHDF5SummarizedExperiment(directory)
```

```{r}
scmeth::coverage(bsObject)
```

### readmetrics
Read information is important to assess whether sequencing and alignment 
succeeded. **readmetrics** function outputs a visualization showing number
of reads seen in each samples and of those reads what proportion of 
them were mapped to the reference genome. 
```{r,fig.width=6,fig.height=3}
scmeth::readmetrics(bsObject)
```

### repmask
<p style="text-align: justify;">
CpG Islands are characterized by their high GC content, high level of observed 
to expected ratio of CpGs and length over 500 bp. However some repeat regions 
in the genome also fit the same criteria although they are not bona fide CpG 
Island. Therefore it is important to see how many CpGs are observed in the non 
repeat regions of the genome. **repMask** functions provide information on the 
CpG coverage in non repeat regions of the genome. In order to build the repeat 
mask regions of the genome **repmask** function will require the organism and 
the genome build information.
</p>

```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,eval=FALSE}
library(BSgenome.Mmusculus.UCSC.mm10)
load(system.file("extdata",'bsObject.rda',package='scmeth'))
scmeth::repMask(bs,Mmusculus,"mm10")
```

### Coverage by Chromosome
<p style="text-align: justify;">
There are several other ways the number of CpGs captured can be visualized. 
One of the way is to observe how the CpGs are distributed across different 
chromosomes. ***chromosomeCoverage** outputs CpG coverage by individual 
chromosomes.(Since the example data only contains information in chromosome 1
only the CpGs covered in chromosome 1 is shown.)

</p>

```{r, warning=FALSE}
scmeth::chromosomeCoverage(bsObject)
```

### featureCoverage
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another way to observe the distribution of CpGs is to classify them by the 
genomic features they belong. Some of the features are very specific to the CpG
dense regions such as CpG Islands, CpG Shores, CpG Shelves etc. Others are 
general genomic features such as introns, exons, promoters etc. This 
information can be obtained by **featureCoverage** function. In addition to the
bs object this function requires the genomic features of interest and the 
genome build. Each element in the table represents the fraction of CpGs
seen in particular cell in specific region compared to all the CpGs seen in 
that region.
</p>
```{r, warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(annotatr)
featureList<-c('genes_exons','genes_introns')
DT::datatable(scmeth::featureCoverage(bsObject,features=featureList,"hg38"))


```
</p>



### cpgDensity
<p style="text-align: justify;">
CpGs are not distributed across the genome uniformly. Most of the genome 
contains very low percentage of CpGs except for the CpG dense regions,
i.e. CpG islands. Bisulfite sequencing targets all the CpGs across the genome,
however reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) target CpG dense CpG
islands. Therefore CpG density plot will be a great diagnostic to see whether 
the protocol succeeded. In order to calculate the CpG density a window length 
should be specified. By default **cpgDensity** function chooses 1kB regions. 
Therefore CpG density plot can be used to check whether the protocol
specifically targeted CpG dense or CpG sparse regions or whether CpGs were 
obtained uniformly across the regions.
</p>

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
library(BSgenome.Hsapiens.NCBI.GRCh38)
DT::datatable(scmeth::cpgDensity(bsObject,Hsapiens,windowLength=1000))
```

### downsample
<p style="text-align: justify;">
In addition to the CpG coverage, methylation data can be assessed via down
sampling analysis, methylation bias plot and methylation distribution. Down 
sampling analysis is a technique to assess whether the sequencing process 
achieved the saturation level in terms of CpG capture. In order to perform 
down sampling analysis CpGs that are covered at least will be sampled via 
binomial random sampling with given probability. At each probability level 
the number of CpGs captured is assessed. If the number of CpG captured attains
a plateau then the sequencing was successful. **downsample** function provides
a matrix of CpG coverage for each sample at various down sampling rates. The
report renders this information into a plot. Downsampling rate ranges from 
0.01 to 1, however users can change the downsampling rates.
</p>

```{r,warning=FALSE}
DT::datatable(scmeth::downsample(bsObject))
```


### mbiasPlot
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Methylation bias plot shows the methylation along the reads. In a high quality 
samples methylation across the read would be more or less a horizontal line. 
However there could be fluctuations in the beginning or the end of the read due
to the quality of the bases. Single cell sequencing samples also can show 
jagged trend in the methylation bias plot due to low read count. Methylation
bias can be assessed via **mbiasPlot** function. This function takes the mbias
file generated from firecloud pipeline and generates the methylation bias plot.
</p>

```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=6}
methylationBiasFile<-'2017-04-21_HG23KBCXY_2_AGGCAGAA_TATCTC_pe.M-bias.txt'
scmeth::mbiasplot(mbiasFiles=system.file("extdata",methylationBiasFile,
                                        package='scmeth'))
```
</p>

### methylationDist
<p style="text-align: justify;">
**methylationDist** function provides the methylation distribution of the 
samples. In this visualization methylation is divided into quantiles and
ordered according to the cells with the lowest methylation to highest 
methylation. In single cell analysis almost all CpGs will be in the highest
quantile or the lowest quantile. This visualization provides information on 
whether there are cells with intermediate methylation. Ideally , in single
cell methylation most methylation should be either 1 or 0. If there
are large number of intermediate methylation this indicates there might be
some error in sequencing. 
</p>
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=6,fig.height=3}
scmeth::methylationDist(bsObject)
```


### bsConversionPlot
<p style="text-align: justify;">
Another important metric in methylation analysis is the bisulfite conversion 
rate. Bisulfite conversion rate indicates out of all the Cytosines in the non
CpG context what fraction of them were methylated. Ideally this number should
be 1 or 100% indicating none of the non CpG context cytosines are methylated. 
However in real data this will not be the case, yet bisulfite conversion
rate below 95% indicates some problem with sample preparation. 
**bsConversionPlot** function generates a plot showing this metric for each 
sample.
</p>
```{r,warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,fig.width=4,fig.height=6}
scmeth::bsConversionPlot(bsObject)
```
