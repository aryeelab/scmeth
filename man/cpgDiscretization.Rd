\title{Discretize the CpG methylation values
to align with single cell analysis}
\usage{
cpgDiscretization(bs, subSample = 1e+06, coverageVec = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{bs}{bsseq object}

\item{subSample}{number of CpGs to subsample}

\item{coverageVec}{If coverage vector is already calculated provide it to
speed up the process}
}
\value{
meth discretized methylation matrix

discard total number of removed CpGs from each sample

Percentage of CpGs discarded compared to the total number of CpGs
}
\description{
In single cell analysis overwhelmingly large number of CpGs have binary
methylation
Due to errors in sequencing and amplification many CpGs tend to have
non-binary methylation. Hence
this function catergorizes the non-binary CpGs as methylated if the
methyation is above 0.8 and
unmethylated if the methylation is below 0.2
